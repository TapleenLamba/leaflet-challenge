# leaflet-challenge

Project Overview:

This project aimed to enhance the visualization capabilities of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) by creating tools to effectively communicate earthquake data. The primary objective was to provide valuable insights to the public and other governmental organizations about global environmental challenges. 

Processes and Technologies:

Utilizing a combination of HTML and JavaScript, this project leveraged the styles.css and index.html files to develop a logic file. The logic file reads JSON data and logs it into the console. The project includes the creation of a tile layer with a street map and the implementation of a function to fetch earthquake data, displaying it on the map through markers. The markers dynamically represent earthquake magnitude through size and depth through color. Additionally, informative popups were incorporated to provide users with detailed earthquake information upon hovering over the markers. The project culminated in the integration of a scaled legend that mirrors the marker characteristics, offering a visual reference for interpreting earthquake data.
